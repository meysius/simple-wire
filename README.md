# simple-wire
simple-wire is an opinionated, lightweight framework for building typescript backends. The main goal of simple-wire is to provide a solid bare minimum structure to help you sustain your delivery speed as your application grows in an unopinionated world such as ExpressJS.

simple-wire's philosophy is that you only need three design patterns to keep delivering efficiently as your application grows:

1. Separate Domain and Presentation Layers
2. Split Domain into Department Slices
3. Use Dependency Injection

## Getting Started
To get started use the following command to create a new simple-wire application using the starter template:

```bash
pnpm create simple-wire@latest
```
